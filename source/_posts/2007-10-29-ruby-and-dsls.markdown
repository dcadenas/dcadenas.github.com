[Here](http://www.xaop.com/articles/2007/10/07/metaprogramming) you can see an excelent screencast by Peter Vanbroekhoven about creating DSLs in Ruby. This is another appealing aspect of the language. At work I program mainly in C# and I couldn't avoid comparing his example with Linq. I still didn't put my hands deeply on Linq, and I guess it must be much bigger than Peter's example but I can't avoid being amazed at the simplicity in which he shows how to have your own hand made Linq in Ruby with very little work.

So Ruby seems to be not just a programming language, it's a DSL programming language which it's something extremely powerful due to the productivity and readability that brings the higher level of abstraction. That's always good.
