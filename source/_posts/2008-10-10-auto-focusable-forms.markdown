Just commited a Rails plugin (my first one, yay!!) to give automatic focus to the first input of the first form in each of your views.

Of course you can disable this behaviour but I think that having focus in the first input by default can be very useful.

You can read more in the project page [here](http://github.com/dcadenas/auto_focusable_forms/tree).
